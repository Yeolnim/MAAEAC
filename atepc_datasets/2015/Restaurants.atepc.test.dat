the O -1
wait B-ASP 1
for O -1
a O -1
table O -1
. O -1

The O -1
place B-ASP 2
is O -1
beautiful! O -1

The O -1
hostess B-ASP 2
was O -1
very O -1
pleasant O -1
. O -1

However, O -1
our O -1
$14 O -1
drinks B-ASP 0
were O -1
were O -1
horrible! O -1

We O -1
also O -1
asked O -1
for O -1
Hooka O -1
six O -1
times O -1
and O -1
the O -1
waiter B-ASP 0
kept O -1
telling O -1
us O -1
one O -1
minute O -1
and O -1
never O -1
returning O -1
with O -1
the O -1
Hooka O -1
. O -1

After O -1
the O -1
4th O -1
time O -1
i O -1
asked O -1
again O -1
and O -1
the O -1
waiter B-ASP 0
than O -1
said O -1
after O -1
our O -1
dinner O -1
. O -1

We O -1
asked O -1
for O -1
sides O -1
which O -1
the O -1
waiter B-ASP 0
than O -1
admitted O -1
that O -1
he O -1
forgot O -1
to O -1
put O -1
in O -1
that O -1
part O -1
of O -1
our O -1
order O -1
. O -1

My O -1
chicken B-ASP 0
was O -1
inedible O -1
as O -1
there O -1
were O -1
so O -1
many O -1
fatty O -1
lumps O -1
which O -1
i O -1
had O -1
to O -1
keep O -1
spitting O -1
out O -1
into O -1
my O -1
napkin O -1
. O -1

I O -1
would O -1
not O -1
expect O -1
this O -1
for O -1
a O -1
$55 O -1
dinner B-ASP 0
. O -1

By O -1
the O -1
time O -1
we O -1
left O -1
our O -1
wallets O -1
were O -1
empy O -1
and O -1
so O -1
were O -1
our O -1
stomachs O -1
AND O -1
we O -1
missed O -1
the O -1
show O -1
we O -1
were O -1
supposed O -1
to O -1
see O -1
following O -1
our O -1
dinner, O -1
which O -1
would O -1
have O -1
been O -1
acceptable O -1
if O -1
we O -1
got O -1
to O -1
enjoy O -1
the O -1
experience O -1
of O -1
good O -1
food B-ASP 0
and O -1
belly O -1
dancers! O -1

If O -1
it O -1
seemed O -1
possible O -1
to O -1
do O -1
so O -1
while O -1
there O -1
I O -1
would O -1
have O -1
fought O -1
my O -1
bill O -1
since O -1
my O -1
dinner O -1
portion O -1
of O -1
my O -1
meal B-ASP 0
was O -1
inedible! O -1

I O -1
have O -1
never O -1
left O -1
a O -1
restaurant B-ASP 0
feeling O -1
as O -1
if O -1
i O -1
was O -1
abused, O -1
and O -1
wasted O -1
my O -1
hard O -1
earned O -1
money O -1
. O -1

The O -1
menu B-ASP 1
is O -1
fairly O -1
simple O -1
without O -1
much O -1

There O -1
was O -1
no O -1

evening, O -1
which O -1
was O -1
a O -1
disappointment O -1

However, O -1
once O -1
I O -1
received O -1
my O -1
predictably O -1
mediocre O -1
order O -1
of O -1
what O -1
Dokebi O -1
thinks O -1
passes O -1
as O -1
Korean O -1
fair, O -1
(sometimes O -1
you O -1
have O -1
to O -1
settle O -1
when O -1
it's O -1
your O -1
only O -1
option), O -1
I O -1
got O -1
through O -1
about O -1
half O -1
my O -1
kimchee B-ASP 0
before O -1
I O -1
found O -1
a O -1
piece O -1
of O -1
random O -1
lettuce O -1
accompanied O -1
by O -1
a O -1
far O -1
more O -1

bad O -1
piece O -1

My O -1
main O -1
concern O -1
was O -1
the O -1
sanity O -1
of O -1
the O -1
food B-ASP 0
that O -1
was O -1
being O -1
sent O -1
out O -1
to O -1
myself O -1
and O -1
others, O -1
but O -1
I O -1
would O -1
be O -1
lying O -1
is O -1
I O -1
said O -1
that O -1
as O -1
someone O -1
who O -1
has O -1
worked O -1
in O -1
restaurants O -1
since O -1
the O -1
age O -1
of O -1

was O -1

a O -1
minimal O -1
effort O -1
on O -1
the O -1
part O -1
of O -1
the O -1

amend O -1
the O -1
situation O -1

It O -1
wasn't O -1
as O -1
if O -1
this O -1
restaurant B-ASP 0
had O -1
any O -1
major O -1
bragging O -1
points O -1
before O -1

but O -1
now O -1
it's O -1
simply O -1
repulsive O -1

the O -1
flavor O -1
of O -1
all O -1

Personally O -1
I O -1
like O -1
the O -1
margherita B-ASP 2
pizza I-ASP 2
better, O -1
but O -1
they O -1
are O -1
all O -1
good O -1
. O -1

Possibly O -1
the O -1
Most O -1
Romantic O -1
Restaurant B-ASP 2
in O -1
the O -1
City O -1

This O -1
is O -1
undoubtedly O -1
my O -1
favorite O -1
modern B-ASP 2
Japanese I-ASP 2
brasserie I-ASP 2
(that O -1
don’t O -1
serve O -1
sushi), O -1
and O -1
in O -1
my O -1
opinion, O -1
one O -1
of O -1
the O -1
most O -1
romantic O -1
restaurants O -1
in O -1
the O -1
city! O -1

Not O -1
only O -1
is O -1
it O -1
an O -1
adventure O -1
getting O -1
to O -1
this O -1
somewhat O -1
hidden O -1
spot, O -1
once O -1
you O -1
enter O -1
the O -1
unmarked O -1
wooden O -1
doors, O -1
the O -1
zen O -1
and O -1
intimate O -1
décor B-ASP 2
will O -1
make O -1
you O -1
feel O -1
like O -1
you’re O -1
no O -1
longer O -1
in O -1
the O -1
city O -1
. O -1

It’s O -1
just O -1
you O -1
and O -1
your O -1
date O -1
and O -1
an O -1
occasional O -1
cute O -1
‘excuse O -1

before O -1
the O -1
waiter B-ASP 2
opens O -1
the O -1
little O -1
curtain O -1
to O -1
your O -1

We O -1
started O -1
off O -1
with O -1
a O -1
delightful O -1
sashimi B-ASP 2
amuse I-ASP 2
bouche I-ASP 2
. O -1

I O -1
picked O -1
the O -1
Grilled B-ASP 2
Black I-ASP 2
Cod I-ASP 2
as O -1
my O -1
entree, O -1
which O -1
I O -1
absolutely O -1
devoured O -1
while O -1
someone O -1

The O -1

served O -1
with O -1
miso O -1

and O -1
rice O -1
. O -1

The O -1
sake’s B-ASP 2
complimented O -1
the O -1
courses O -1
very O -1
well O -1
and O -1
is O -1
successfully O -1
easing O -1
me O -1
into O -1
the O -1
sake O -1
world O -1
. O -1

For O -1
desserts, O -1
we O -1
tried O -1
the O -1
frozen B-ASP 1
black I-ASP 1
sesame I-ASP 1
mousse I-ASP 1
(interesting O -1
but O -1
not O -1
extraordinary) O -1
and O -1
matcha O -1
(powdered O -1
green O -1
tea) O -1
and O -1
blueberry O -1
cheesecake, O -1
which O -1
was O -1
phenomenal O -1
. O -1

Maybe O -1
it O -1
was O -1
the O -1
great O -1
company O -1
(I O -1
had O -1
friends O -1
visiting O -1
from O -1
Philly O -1
– O -1
yes, O -1
it O -1

or O -1
the O -1
super O -1
reasonable O -1

I O -1
just O -1
can’t O -1
say O -1
enough O -1
good O -1
things O -1
about O -1
this O -1
brasserie B-ASP 2

I O -1
don’t O -1
usually O -1
visit O -1
the O -1
same O -1
establishment O -1
more O -1
than O -1
once, O -1
what O -1
more O -1
twice, O -1
but O -1
I’ll O -1
come O -1
to O -1
Zenkichi B-ASP 2
anytime O -1
for O -1
a O -1
quiet, O -1
unhurried O -1
and O -1
memorable O -1
dinner O -1

The O -1

I O -1
have O -1
been O -1
going O -1
to O -1
restaurants O -1
tasted O -1
salmon B-ASP 0
as O -1
fishy, O -1
as O -1
dry, O -1
and O -1
as O -1
bland O -1
as O -1
the O -1
one O -1
in O -1
Flatbush O -1
Farms O -1
. O -1

At O -1
this O -1
point, O -1
the O -1
waitress B-ASP 0
comes O -1
over O -1
and O -1
asks O -1
us O -1
if O -1
everything O -1
was O -1
okay, O -1
I O -1
was O -1
literally O -1
so O -1
shocked O -1
that O -1
I O -1
was O -1
speechless O -1
and O -1
didn't O -1
say O -1
anything, O -1
and O -1
guess O -1
what, O -1
the O -1
waitress O -1
WALKED O -1
away O -1
. O -1

So, O -1
I O -1
switch O -1
with O -1
my O -1
boyfriend O -1
again O -1
to O -1
see O -1
if O -1
maybe O -1
I O -1
could O -1
stomach O -1
the O -1
meat O -1
and O -1
spinach B-ASP 0
again, O -1
but O -1
the O -1
spinach O -1
was O -1
so O -1
undercooked O -1
that O -1
I O -1
just O -1
could O -1
not O -1
bite O -1
through O -1
it O -1

absolutely O -1
nothing O -1
we O -1
can O -1
do, O -1
it's O -1
a O -1
matter O -1
of O -1

she O -1
didn't O -1
like O -1
it, O -1

cannot O -1
comp O -1
