Ever O -1
Had O -1

Everyone O -1
that O -1
sat O -1
in O -1

had O -1
ever O -1
received O -1

Some O -1
of O -1
the O -1
food B-ASP 2
is O -1
clearly O -1
oriented O -1
toward O -1
foodies O -1
(like O -1
me) O -1
so O -1
if O -1
your O -1
not O -1

(nothing O -1

I O -1
can O -1
tell O -1
you O -1
that O -1
the O -1

is O -1
just O -1
okay O -1

there O -1

Rice B-ASP 0

have O -1
found O -1
the O -1
quality O -1
and O -1
variety O -1
of O -1
the O -1
fish B-ASP 2
to O -1
be O -1
excellent O -1
. O -1

However, O -1
the O -1
value O -1
and O -1
service B-ASP 0
are O -1
both O -1
severely O -1
lacking O -1
. O -1

Furthermore, O -1
while O -1
the O -1
fish B-ASP 2
is O -1
unquestionably O -1

ranges O -1
from O -1
mediocre O -1

On O -1
a O -1
recent O -1
trip, O -1
our O -1
waiter B-ASP 0
was O -1
extremely O -1
dismissive, O -1
while O -1
no O -1
less O -1
than O -1
three O -1
staff O -1
members O -1
waited O -1
hand-and-foot O -1

The O -1
only O -1
drawback B-ASP -1
is O -1
that O -1
this O -1
place B-ASP 0
is O -1
really O -1
expensive B-ASP -1

reminded O -1
me O -1
of O -1
Italy, O -1

had O -1
artwork B-ASP 2

an O -1

The O -1
presentation O -1
of O -1
Snooze B-ASP 0
is O -1
excellent O -1
and O -1
it O -1
is O -1
one O -1
of O -1
those O -1
places O -1
that O -1
you O -1
feel O -1
more O -1
sophisticated O -1
just O -1
for O -1
being O -1
there; O -1
but O -1
peel O -1
back O -1
the O -1
layers O -1
and O -1
you O -1
have O -1
an O -1
overpriced O -1
IHOP O -1

I O -1
should O -1
have O -1
just O -1
asked O -1
for O -1
the O -1
check O -1
when O -1
I O -1
saw O -1
that; O -1
but O -1
their O -1
menu B-ASP 2
was O -1
so O -1
unique O -1
that O -1
I O -1
continued O -1
. O -1

The O -1
pancakes B-ASP 2
were O -1
certainly O -1
inventive O -1

$8 O -1

The O -1
pancakes B-ASP 0
should O -1
be O -1
larger O -1
(at O -1

8") O -1
to O -1

the O -1
expense O -1
even O -1
with O -1
the O -1
unique O -1
offerings O -1

The O -1
flavors O -1
were O -1
good O -1

I O -1
have O -1
had O -1
far O -1
better O -1
pancakes B-ASP 0
at O -1
a O -1
German O -1

that O -1
were O -1
a O -1
little O -1
cheaper O -1

significantly O -1

On O -1
my O -1
meal B-ASP -1
I O -1
had O -1
to O -1
send O -1
back O -1
my O -1
eggs B-ASP 0

simple O -1
request O -1
of O -1
breaking O -1
the O -1

something O -1

the O -1

I O -1
was O -1
too O -1
frustrated O -1

continue O -1

their O -1

the O -1

no O -1

that O -1
the O -1

only O -1
the O -1

about O -1

The O -1
scallops B-ASP 2
are O -1
apparently O -1
cooked O -1
in O -1
a O -1
black O -1
olive O -1
butter O -1
which O -1
really O -1
makes O -1
them O -1
