still O -1
be O -1
better O -1

Food B-ASP 2
was O -1
very O -1
good O -1

I O -1
wish O -1
the O -1
pork O -1

that O -1
I O -1
ordered O -1
was O -1
roasted O -1
a O -1

longer, O -1
so O -1
that O -1

more O -1

casual O -1

It's O -1
a O -1

Yamato B-ASP 2
is O -1
an O -1

Mazing O -1
interior B-ASP 0
. O -1

The O -1
atmosphere B-ASP 0
was O -1
pretty O -1
nice O -1
but O -1
had O -1
a O -1
bit O -1
lacking, O -1
which O -1
it O -1
tries O -1
to O -1
make O -1
up O -1
for O -1
with O -1
a O -1
crazy O -1
scheme O -1
of O -1
mirrors O -1
. O -1

Despite O -1
the O -1
confusing O -1
mirrors B-ASP 0
this O -1
will O -1
likely O -1
be O -1
my O -1
go-to O -1
for O -1
modern O -1
Japanese O -1
food O -1
for O -1
the O -1
foreseeable O -1
future O -1

Not O -1
a O -1
very O -1
fancy O -1
place B-ASP 1
but O -1
very O -1
good O -1
Chinese O -1
style O -1
Indian O -1
food O -1
. O -1

The O -1
chicken O -1
lollipop O -1
is O -1

favorite, O -1
most O -1
of O -1
the O -1
dishes B-ASP 0
(I O -1
have O -1
to O -1
agree O -1
with O -1
a O -1
previous O -1
reviewer) O -1

quite O -1
oily O -1

My O -1
mom O -1
originally O -1
introduced O -1
me O -1
to O -1
this O -1
place, O -1
but O -1
even O -1
she O -1
(being O -1
Indian) O -1
feels O -1
the O -1
food B-ASP 0
can O -1
be O -1
somewhat O -1
over O -1
the O -1
top O -1
spicy O -1
and O -1
far O -1
too O -1
oily O -1
. O -1

I O -1
was O -1
speechless O -1
by O -1
the O -1
horrible O -1
food B-ASP 0

I O -1
attended O -1
a O -1
holiday O -1
dinner O -1
at O -1
the O -1
restaurant, O -1
and O -1
the O -1
food B-ASP 0
was O -1
majorly O -1
disappointing O -1
. O -1

Rather O -1
than O -1
preparing O -1
vegetarian O -1
dish, O -1
the O -1
chef B-ASP 0
presented O -1
me O -1
with O -1
a O -1
plate O -1
of O -1
steamed O -1
vegetables O -1
(minus O -1
sauce, O -1
seasoning, O -1

any O -1

or O -1
aesthetic O -1

good O -1
but O -1
not O -1
amazing O -1
. O -1

Bison B-ASP 2
was O -1
quite O -1
excellent O -1
however O -1
. O -1

I O -1
read O -1
reviews O -1
that O -1
called O -1
the O -1
restaurant B-ASP 0
too O -1
expensive O -1
and O -1
I O -1
thought O -1
to O -1
myself, O -1
but O -1
may O -1
be O -1
it O -1
is O -1
worth O -1
it O -1
. O -1

All O -1
in O -1
all, O -1
the O -1
food B-ASP 2
was O -1
great O -1
(except O -1
for O -1
the O -1
dessserts) O -1
. O -1

The O -1
environment B-ASP 1
is O -1
very O -1
upscale O -1
and O -1
you O -1
will O -1
see O -1
a O -1
lot O -1
of O -1
rich O -1
guys O -1
with O -1
trophy O -1
wives O -1
or O -1
just O -1
highly O -1
paid O -1
escorts O -1
. O -1

Service B-ASP 0
was O -1
just O -1
ok, O -1
it O -1
is O -1
not O -1
what O -1
you'd O -1
expect O -1
for O -1
$500 O -1
. O -1

We O -1
did O -1
arrive O -1
late O -1
for O -1
our O -1
reservation O -1
so O -1
I O -1
can O -1
not O -1
complain O -1
too O -1
much O -1
about O -1
the O -1
wait B-ASP 1
for O -1
a O -1
table O -1
. O -1

The O -1
place B-ASP 2
is O -1
beautiful! O -1

The O -1
hostess B-ASP 2
was O -1
very O -1
pleasant O -1
. O -1

However, O -1
our O -1
$14 O -1
drinks B-ASP 0
were O -1
were O -1
horrible! O -1

We O -1
also O -1
asked O -1
for O -1
Hooka O -1
six O -1
times O -1
and O -1
the O -1
waiter B-ASP 0
kept O -1
telling O -1
us O -1
one O -1
minute O -1
and O -1
never O -1
returning O -1
with O -1
the O -1
Hooka O -1
. O -1

After O -1
the O -1
4th O -1
time O -1
i O -1
asked O -1
again O -1
and O -1
the O -1
waiter B-ASP 0
than O -1
said O -1
after O -1
our O -1
dinner O -1
. O -1

We O -1
asked O -1
for O -1
sides O -1
which O -1
the O -1
waiter B-ASP 0
than O -1
admitted O -1
that O -1
he O -1
forgot O -1
to O -1
put O -1
in O -1
that O -1
part O -1
of O -1
our O -1
order O -1
. O -1

My O -1
chicken B-ASP 0
was O -1
inedible O -1
as O -1
there O -1
were O -1
so O -1
many O -1
fatty O -1
lumps O -1
which O -1
i O -1
had O -1
to O -1
keep O -1
spitting O -1
out O -1
into O -1
my O -1
napkin O -1
. O -1

I O -1
would O -1
not O -1
expect O -1
this O -1
for O -1
a O -1
$55 O -1
dinner B-ASP 0
. O -1

By O -1
the O -1
time O -1
we O -1
left O -1
our O -1
wallets O -1
were O -1
empy O -1
and O -1
so O -1
were O -1
our O -1
stomachs O -1
AND O -1
we O -1
missed O -1
the O -1
show O -1
we O -1
were O -1
supposed O -1
to O -1
see O -1
following O -1
our O -1
dinner, O -1
which O -1
would O -1
have O -1
been O -1
acceptable O -1
if O -1
we O -1
got O -1
to O -1
enjoy O -1
the O -1
experience O -1
of O -1
good O -1
food B-ASP 0
and O -1
belly O -1
dancers! O -1

If O -1
it O -1
seemed O -1
possible O -1
to O -1
do O -1
so O -1
while O -1
there O -1
I O -1
would O -1
have O -1
fought O -1
my O -1
bill O -1
since O -1
my O -1
dinner O -1
portion O -1
of O -1
my O -1
meal B-ASP 0
was O -1
inedible! O -1

I O -1
have O -1
never O -1
left O -1
a O -1
restaurant B-ASP 0
feeling O -1
as O -1
if O -1
i O -1
was O -1
abused, O -1
and O -1
wasted O -1
my O -1
hard O -1
earned O -1
money O -1
. O -1

The O -1
menu B-ASP 1
is O -1
fairly O -1
simple O -1
without O -1
much O -1
descriptions O -1
. O -1

There O -1
was O -1
no O -1
tap O -1
beer B-ASP 0
that O -1
evening, O -1
which O -1
was O -1
a O -1
disappointment O -1
. O -1

All O -1
in O -1
all O -1
the O -1
food B-ASP 2
was O -1
good O -1
- O -1
a O -1
little O -1
on O -1
the O -1
expensive O -1
side, O -1
but O -1

Food B-ASP 2
was O -1
amazing O -1
- O -1
I O -1
love O -1
Indian O -1
food O -1
and O -1
eat O -1
it O -1
quite O -1
regularly, O -1

I O -1
can O -1
say O -1
this O -1
is O -1
one O -1
of O -1
the O -1
best O -1
I've O -1
had O -1
. O -1

I O -1
have O -1
it O -1
a O -1
4 O -1

of O -1

at O -1

this O -1

doesn't O -1

Also, O -1
waiters B-ASP 0

to O -1
push O -1
more O -1

you, O -1

to O -1
ask O -1
if O -1
something O -1
they O -1

complimentary, O -1
then O -1
this O -1
is O -1

top O -1
5 O -1
Indian O -1
places O -1
in O -1

I O -1
have O -1
never O -1

However, O -1
once O -1
I O -1
received O -1
my O -1
predictably O -1
mediocre O -1
order O -1
of O -1
what O -1
Dokebi O -1
thinks O -1
passes O -1
as O -1
Korean O -1
fair, O -1
(sometimes O -1
you O -1
have O -1
to O -1
settle O -1
when O -1
it's O -1
your O -1
only O -1
option), O -1
I O -1
got O -1
through O -1
about O -1
half O -1
my O -1
kimchee B-ASP 0
before O -1
I O -1
found O -1
a O -1
piece O -1
of O -1
random O -1
lettuce O -1
accompanied O -1
by O -1
a O -1
far O -1
more O -1
disgusting, O -1
slimy, O -1
clearly O -1
bad O -1
piece O -1
of O -1
fish O -1

. O -1

My O -1
main O -1
concern O -1
was O -1
the O -1
sanity O -1
of O -1
the O -1
food B-ASP 0
that O -1
was O -1
being O -1
sent O -1
out O -1
to O -1
myself O -1
and O -1
others, O -1
but O -1
I O -1
would O -1
be O -1
lying O -1
is O -1
I O -1
said O -1
that O -1
as O -1
someone O -1
who O -1
has O -1
worked O -1
in O -1
restaurants O -1
since O -1
the O -1
age O -1
of O -1
fifteen O -1
I O -1
was O -1
expecting O -1
at O -1
least O -1
a O -1
minimal O -1
effort O -1
on O -1
the O -1
part O -1
of O -1
the O -1
restaurant O -1
to O -1
amend O -1
the O -1
situation O -1
. O -1

It O -1
wasn't O -1
as O -1
if O -1
this O -1
restaurant B-ASP 0
had O -1
any O -1
major O -1
bragging O -1
points O -1
before O -1
hand, O -1
but O -1
now O -1
it's O -1
simply O -1
repulsive O -1
. O -1

Gorgeous O -1
place B-ASP 2
ideal O -1
for O -1
a O -1
romantic O -1
dinner O -1

The O -1
service B-ASP 2
was O -1
spectacular O -1
as O -1
the O -1
waiter B-ASP -1
knew O -1
everything O -1
about O -1
the O -1
menu O -1
and O -1
his O -1
recommendations O -1
were O -1
amazing! O -1

The O -1
bibimbap B-ASP 1
was O -1
average, O -1
but O -1
the O -1
stone O -1
bowl O -1
wasn't O -1
even O -1
close O -1
to O -1
sizzling O -1
. O -1

The O -1
nakgi-bokum B-ASP 0
was O -1
horrible O -1
. O -1

The O -1
sauce B-ASP 0
tasted O -1
more O -1
like O -1
Chinese O -1
fast O -1
food O -1
than O -1
decent O -1
Korean O -1
. O -1

The O -1
real O -1
problem O -1
I O -1
had O -1
with O -1
this O -1
place O -1
was O -1
the O -1
complete O -1
lack O -1
of O -1
service B-ASP 0
. O -1

My O -1
wife O -1
had O -1
barely O -1
touched O -1
that O -1
mess O -1
of O -1
a O -1
dish B-ASP 0
. O -1

The O -1
wife O -1
had O -1
the O -1
risotto B-ASP 2
which O -1
was O -1
amazing O -1
. O -1

The O -1
crust B-ASP 2
has O -1
a O -1
great O -1
bite O -1
and O -1
a O -1
good O -1
chew, O -1
the O -1
sauce B-ASP -1
is O -1
light O -1

it, O -1
the O -1

the O -1

The O -1
food B-ASP 2
was O -1
great O -1
and O -1
tasty, O -1

the O -1
sitting O -1

was O -1

small, O -1
I O -1
don't O -1
like O -1
being O -1

in O -1
a O -1

Over O -1
all O -1
it O -1
was O -1
a O -1
very O -1
nice O -1
romantic O -1
place B-ASP 2
. O -1

A O -1
coworker O -1

I O -1
tried O -1
Pacifico B-ASP 2
after O -1
work O -1
a O -1
few O -1

loved O -1

great O -1

The O -1
food B-ASP 2

ordered O -1
was O -1
excellent, O -1

wouldn't O -1

Our O -1

wasn't O -1
mean, O -1

not O -1
especially O -1
warm O -1
or O -1
attentive O -1
either O -1

I O -1
must O -1

I O -1
am O -1
surprised O -1
by O -1
the O -1
bad O -1
reviews O -1
of O -1
the O -1
restaurant B-ASP 2
earlier O -1
in O -1
the O -1
year, O -1
though O -1
. O -1

Regardless, O -1
we'll O -1
be O -1
back O -1
and O -1
can't O -1
wait O -1
to O -1
visit O -1
in O -1
the O -1
summer O -1

take O -1
advantage O -1

The O -1
servers B-ASP 0
at O -1
Flatbush O -1
Farm O -1
appear O -1

have O -1
perfected O -1
that O -1
ghastly O -1
technique O -1
of O -1
making O -1
you O -1
feel O -1
guilty O -1

ashamed O -1

deigning O -1
to O -1
attract O -1
their O -1
attention O -1

A O -1

the O -1

quality O -1
was O -1
pretty O -1
good, O -1

I O -1
hear O -1
the O -1
salmon O -1
is O -1
much O -1
better O -1
when O -1
it O -1
hasn't O -1
sat O -1

what O -1
I O -1
could O -1
tell, O -1
a O -1
reasonable O -1
wine O -1
list O -1
(I O -1
was O -1
given O -1

when O -1
I O -1
asked O -1
for O -1
the O -1

How O -1
is O -1
this O -1
palce B-ASP 0
still O -1
open? O -1

Everything O -1
was O -1
going O -1
good O -1
until O -1
we O -1
got O -1
our O -1
meals B-ASP 0
. O -1

I O -1
took O -1
one O -1
look O -1
at O -1
the O -1
chicken B-ASP 0
and O -1
I O -1
was O -1
appalled O -1
. O -1

It O -1
was O -1
served O -1
with O -1
skin, O -1
over O -1
a O -1
bed O -1
of O -1
extremely O -1
undercooked O -1
spinach B-ASP 0
and O -1
mashed O -1
potatoes O -1
. O -1

I O -1
took O -1
one O -1
bite O -1
from O -1
the O -1
$24 O -1
salmon, O -1
and O -1
I O -1
have O -1
never, O -1
in O -1
the O -1
17 O -1
years O -1
I O -1
have O -1
been O -1
going O -1
to O -1
restaurants O -1
tasted O -1
salmon B-ASP 0
as O -1
fishy, O -1
as O -1
dry, O -1
and O -1
as O -1
bland O -1
as O -1
the O -1
one O -1
in O -1
Flatbush O -1
Farms O -1
. O -1

At O -1
this O -1
point, O -1
the O -1
waitress B-ASP 0
comes O -1
over O -1
and O -1
asks O -1
us O -1
if O -1
everything O -1
was O -1
okay, O -1
I O -1
was O -1
literally O -1
so O -1
shocked O -1
that O -1
I O -1
was O -1
speechless O -1
and O -1
didn't O -1
say O -1
anything, O -1
and O -1
guess O -1
what, O -1
the O -1
waitress O -1
WALKED O -1
away O -1
. O -1

So, O -1
I O -1
switch O -1
with O -1
my O -1
boyfriend O -1
again O -1
to O -1
see O -1
if O -1
maybe O -1
I O -1
could O -1
stomach O -1
the O -1
meat O -1
and O -1
spinach B-ASP 0
again, O -1
but O -1
the O -1
spinach O -1
was O -1
so O -1
undercooked O -1
that O -1
I O -1
just O -1
could O -1
not O -1
bite O -1
through O -1
it O -1
. O -1

This O -1
is O -1
where O -1
it O -1
really O -1

gets O -1
bad: O -1
the O -1

absolutely O -1
nothing O -1
we O -1
can O -1
do, O -1
it's O -1
a O -1
matter O -1
of O -1
taste O -1
that O -1
she O -1
didn't O -1
like O -1
it, O -1
and O -1
I O -1
cannot O -1
comp O -1
it O -1
. O -1

said O -1
we O -1

hot O -1

Slamwich B-ASP 2
is O -1
amazing! O -1

Going O -1
to O -1
Bark B-ASP 2
is O -1
always O -1
worth O -1
the O -1
train O -1
ride, O -1
and O -1
will O -1
make O -1
your O -1
tongue O -1
and O -1
belly O -1
very O -1
happy! O -1

Only O -1
complaint O -1
is O -1
the O -1
pricing--I O -1
believe O -1
it O -1
would O -1
be O -1
more O -1
reasonable O -1
to O -1
pay O -1
a O -1
dollar O -1
less O -1
on O -1
each O -1
item O -1
listed O -1
on O -1
the O -1
menu B-ASP 0
. O -1

But O -1
nonetheless--great O -1
spot, O -1
great O -1
food B-ASP 2

Fabulous O -1
food B-ASP 2
- O -1
if O -1
the O -1
front O -1
of O -1
house O -1
staff O -1
don't O -1
put O -1
you O -1
off O -1
閳? O -1

Each O -1
time O -1
we've O -1
been, O -1
the O -1
front O -1
of O -1
house O -1
staff O -1
(not O -1
the O -1
waiters B-ASP 2
- O -1
they're O -1
fantastic O -1
- O -1
but O -1
the O -1
people O -1
who O -1
greet O -1
and O -1
seat O -1
you) O -1
has O -1
been O -1
so O -1
hideous O -1
to O -1
us O -1
that O -1
were O -1
it O -1
not O -1
for O -1
the O -1
exceptional O -1
fish O -1
dishes O -1
I O -1
would O -1
never O -1
return O -1
. O -1

As O -1
BFC B-ASP 0
doesn't O -1
take O -1
reservations O -1
you O -1
almost O -1
always O -1
have O -1
to O -1
wait O -1
by O -1
the O -1
bar O -1
- O -1
and O -1
be O -1
abused O -1
by O -1
the O -1
front O -1
of O -1
house O -1
staff O -1
until O -1
you O -1
are O -1
seated, O -1
which O -1
can O -1
be O -1
over O -1
an O -1
hour O -1
later! O -1

The O -1
frizzy O -1
retro O -1
girl B-ASP 0
(with O -1
winged/ O -1
Dame O -1
Edna O -1
glasses) O -1
will O -1
yell O -1
at O -1
you O -1
if O -1
you O -1
try O -1
to O -1
order O -1
a O -1
drink O -1
. O -1

I'd O -1
be O -1
horrified O -1
if O -1
my O -1
staff B-ASP 0
were O -1
turning O -1
away O -1
customers O -1
so O -1
early O -1
and O -1
so O -1
rudely! O -1

There's O -1
another O -1
girl B-ASP 0
who O -1
I O -1
can't O -1
describe, O -1
she O -1
is O -1
about O -1
5'6" O -1
with O -1
brown O -1
hair, O -1
who O -1
eavesdrops O -1
on O -1
your O -1
conversation O -1
and O -1
chimes O -1
in O -1
- O -1
except O -1
she O -1
only O -1
hears O -1
the O -1
last O -1
part O -1
of O -1
what O -1
you O -1
said, O -1
so O -1
her O -1
uninvited O -1
opinions O -1
are O -1
often O -1
out O -1
of O -1
context O -1
and O -1
nothing O -1
to O -1
do O -1
with O -1
what O -1
you're O -1
*really* O -1
talking O -1
about O -1
. O -1

Considering O -1
you O -1
will O -1
spend O -1
at O -1
least O -1
$60 O -1
a O -1
head, O -1
I O -1
expect O -1
better O -1

The O -1
food B-ASP 2

left, O -1

shortly O -1
by O -1

of O -1
us, O -1

not O -1

At O -1
first O -1
glance O -1
this O -1
place O -1
seems O -1
a O -1
bit O -1
pricey O -1
for O -1
a O -1
hot O -1

joint, O -1

at O -1

believe O -1
how O -1
an O -1

disrespectful O -1

like O -1

was O -1
insane O -1

I O -1
was O -1
shocked O -1

the O -1
