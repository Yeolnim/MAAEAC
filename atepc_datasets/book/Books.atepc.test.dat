The O -1

far-fetched O -1
premise, O -1

to O -1

The O -1

I O -1
was O -1

was O -1
readable, O -1
albeit O -1
unrealistic O -1

Without O -1
giving O -1
away O -1
anything O -1
significant, O -1
I O -1
can O -1
tell O -1
you O -1
that O -1
a O -1
major O -1
portion O -1
of O -1
the O -1
book O -1
was O -1
centered O -1
around O -1
a O -1
police B-ASP 1
officer I-ASP 1
assuming O -1
an O -1
alias O -1

Unfortunately, O -1
I O -1
was O -1
a O -1
little O -1
surprised, O -1
and O -1
very O -1
disappointed O -1
in O -1
the O -1
way O -1
the O -1
author B-ASP 0
chose O -1
to O -1
reveal O -1
the O -1
main B-ASP -1
undercover I-ASP -1
operation I-ASP -1
to O -1

I O -1
was O -1

little O -1
surprised, O -1
and O -1
very O -1
disappointed O -1
in O -1
the O -1
way O -1
the O -1

to O -1
reveal O -1
the O -1
main B-ASP 0
undercover I-ASP 0
operation I-ASP 0
to O -1
the O -1
criminal O -1

The O -1
unraveling O -1
of O -1
the O -1
cover B-ASP 0
was O -1
brought O -1
about O -1
by O -1
a O -1
mistake O -1
that O -1
I O -1
found O -1
completely O -1
innane O -1

I O -1
could O -1
not O -1
believe O -1
that O -1
a O -1
rookie, O -1
much O -1
less O -1
a O -1
seasoned O -1
officer O -1
would O -1
slip O -1
up O -1
as O -1
the O -1
author O -1
has O -1
Carol B-ASP 1
(and O -1
Tony) O -1
slip O -1
up O -1

This O -1
disbelief O -1
is O -1
compounded O -1
by O -1
the O -1
lengths O -1
that O -1
are O -1
taken O -1
initially O -1
to O -1
insure O -1
that O -1
the O -1
operation B-ASP 1
is O -1
not O -1
comprimised O -1

I O -1
was O -1
disappointed O -1
enough O -1
in O -1
the O -1
book B-ASP 0
to O -1
move O -1
along O -1
to O -1
another O -1
author, O -1
as O -1
opposed O -1
to O -1
reading O -1
the O -1
rest O -1
of O -1
the O -1
Carol O -1
Jordan/Tony O -1
Hill O -1
saga O -1

I O -1
thought O -1
the O -1
writing O -1
skills O -1
of O -1
the O -1
author B-ASP 1
were O -1
good, O -1
but O -1
the O -1
storytelling O -1
skills O -1
were O -1
not O -1

I O -1
read O -1
this O -1
book B-ASP 2
in O -1
high O -1
school O -1
and O -1
loved O -1
it O -1

One O -1
of O -1
my O -1
favorite O -1

It O -1
was O -1
a O -1
great O -1
book B-ASP 2
and O -1
its O -1
based O -1
in O -1
a O -1
place O -1
near O -1
where O -1
I O -1
live O -1

I O -1
think O -1
it O -1
was O -1
good O -1
because O -1
when O -1
he O -1
figures O -1
out O -1
who O -1
the O -1

he's O -1
eye O -1

him O -1

This O -1
book B-ASP 2
is O -1
such O -1
a O -1
clever, O -1
compelling O -1
read O -1
that O -1
I O -1
was O -1
sorely O -1
disappointed O -1
to O -1
have O -1
to O -1
wait O -1

we O -1
could O -1
say, O -1

the O -1

The O -1

The O -1
main O -1

came, O -1

My O -1
only O -1
complaint O -1
is O -1
that O -1
Garth B-ASP 1

takes O -1
about O -1
a O -1

every O -1

he O -1
writes O -1
and O -1
that's O -1
a O -1
long O -1
time O -1
to O -1
wait O -1

I O -1
am O -1
sure O -1
Paul B-ASP 1
Zindel I-ASP 1
means O -1
well, O -1
but O -1
his O -1
outlook O -1
on O -1
human B-ASP -1
life I-ASP -1
is O -1
simplistic O -1
at O -1
best O -1
and O -1
cynical O -1

skimming, O -1

eventually O -1
I O -1
got O -1
at O -1

a O -1
glimmer O -1
of O -1
a O -1
storyline O -1

a O -1
young B-ASP 1
nine I-ASP 1
year I-ASP 1
old I-ASP 1
girl I-ASP 1
who O -1
at O -1
first O -1
seems O -1

she's O -1
been O -1
kidnapped O -1
by O -1
an O -1
evil, O -1
foul O -1
smelling O -1
man, O -1
but O -1
within O -1
a O -1
few O -1
pages O -1
we O -1
find O -1
out O -1
that O -1
this O -1
abduction O -1
is O -1
not O -1
really O -1
what O -1
it O -1
seems O -1
and O -1
the O -1
the O -1
9 O -1
year O -1
old, O -1
cute O -1
little O -1
Madison, O -1
exhibits O -1
the O -1
cold, O -1
maniacal O -1

of O -1
an O -1

and O -1
an O -1

one O -1
at O -1
that O -1

why? O -1
Why? O -1
Why? O -1

my O -1

nothing O -1

this O -1

both O -1

The O -1

very O -1

deeply O -1
drawn O -1

the O -1

The O -1
only O -1
reason O -1
I O -1
gave O -1
this O -1
4 O -1
stars O -1
was O -1
the O -1
fact O -1
that O -1
my O -1

was O -1
too O -1
young O -1
for O -1
some O -1

the O -1

making O -1
this O -1

not O -1
appropriate O -1
for O -1
all O -1
ages O -1

I O -1
just O -1
finished O -1

everything O -1

These, O -1
along O -1
with O -1
Mr B-ASP -1
Monday I-ASP -1
and O -1
his O -1
avenging O -1
messengers O -1
with O -1
blood-stained O -1
wings, O -1
will O -1
stop O -1
at O -1
nothing O -1
to O -1
get O -1
back O -1
the O -1
key, O -1
even O -1
if O -1
it O -1
means O -1
destroying O -1
Arthur B-ASP 1

In O -1
desperation, O -1
Arthur B-ASP 1
ventures O -1
into O -1
a O -1
mysterious O -1
house--a O -1
house O -1
only O -1
he O -1
can O -1
see O -1

This O -1
is O -1
where O -1
Arthur B-ASP 1

of O -1
the O -1

I O -1
found O -1
this O -1
book B-ASP 2
(especially O -1
the O -1
Prologue) O -1
more O -1
bizarre O -1
than O -1
either O -1
Sabriel O -1
or O -1
Lirael, O -1
but O -1
every O -1
bit O -1
as O -1
engrossing O -1

I O -1
have O -1
to O -1
marvel O -1
at O -1
an O -1
author B-ASP 2
who O -1
publishes O -1
the O -1
first O -1

Garth B-ASP 1

first, O -1
highly O -1

book O -1
of O -1
The O -1

A O -1

disappears O -1
from O -1
Oregon's O -1

her O -1
inattentive O -1

despondent O -1

deteriorating O -1
state O -1
of O -1
her O -1

dozes O -1

their O -1

But O -1
the O -1
tale B-ASP 1
of O -1
The B-ASP -1
Intruders I-ASP -1
truly O -1
begins O -1
when O -1
Jack O -1

Suddenly, O -1
everything O -1
Jack B-ASP 1
thinks O -1
he O -1
knows O -1
about O -1
his O -1
life O -1
is O -1
being O -1

whose O -1
recent O -1

(a O -1

The B-ASP 2

succeeds O -1

the O -1

about O -1
adventure, O -1

also O -1
about O -1
