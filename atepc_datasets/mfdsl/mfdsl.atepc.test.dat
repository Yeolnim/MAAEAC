a O -1
poetic O -1

the O -1

it O -1
is O -1
always O -1
difficult O -1
to O -1
translate O -1
literature B-ASP 0
into O -1
other O -1

Having O -1
said O -1
that O -1

I O -1
think O -1
this O -1
is O -1
an O -1
excellent O -1

for O -1
those O -1
who O -1
want O -1
an O -1

those O -1
who O -1

reading O -1
Three O -1

for O -1
the O -1
first O -1

Also O -1
I O -1
strongly O -1
recommend O -1
an O -1
unabridged O -1
version O -1

such O -1
as O -1
this O -1
one O -1
If O -1
you O -1
read O -1
an O -1
abridged O -1
version B-ASP 0

the O -1

wont O -1
seem O -1
well O -1
developed O -1
The O -1
full O -1

necessary O -1
I O -1
especially O -1
recommend O -1
this O -1
novel O -1
for O -1
those O -1
who O -1
are O -1
studying O -1

nothing O -1

as O -1
a O -1

I O -1
still O -1
find O -1

off O -1

Again O -1

the O -1

is O -1
whether O -1

wont O -1
affect O -1
hisher O -1
enjoyment O -1

Just O -1
the O -1
fact O -1
that O -1
there O -1

a O -1
translation B-ASP 2
of O -1
this O -1
extremely O -1
important O -1
work O -1
of O -1
Chinese O -1
literature O -1
is O -1
a O -1
cause O -1
for O -1
celebration O -1

this O -1
set O -1
of O -1
books B-ASP 2
is O -1
a O -1
great O -1
discovery O -1

The O -1

the O -1

writing O -1

are O -1
great O -1
Only O -1
complaint O -1
is O -1
that O -1
comers O -1
of O -1
the O -1
books B-ASP 2
came O -1
are O -1
bent O -1
and O -1

the O -1
actual O -1

fantastic O -1
Moss O -1

simply O -1
wonderful O -1
however O -1

the O -1

completely O -1
that O -1
the O -1

were O -1
warped O -1
almost O -1
to O -1
the O -1
point B-ASP -1
of O -1
disfigurement O -1
quite O -1
a O -1

the O -1
other O -1

The O -1

makes O -1
the O -1

literally O -1

to O -1
read O -1
I O -1
know O -1
they O -1
did O -1
this O -1
to O -1
cut O -1
costs O -1

but O -1
this O -1
is O -1
stupid O -1
if O -1
you O -1
cant O -1
even O -1
read O -1
the O -1
book O -1
I O -1
would O -1
have O -1
rather O -1
paid O -1
an O -1
extra O -1

for O -1
some O -1
thicker O -1
pages B-ASP 0

an O -1

Try O -1

find O -1
a O -1

and O -1
two O -1

the O -1

is O -1
good O -1
and O -1
the O -1
product B-ASP -1
is O -1
what O -1
I O -1
asked O -1
for O -1
So O -1
the O -1
books O -1
are O -1
apparently O -1
not O -1

the O -1

a O -1
very O -1
bad O -1

Also O -1
I O -1
had O -1
some O -1
problems O -1
with O -1
the O -1

at O -1
first O -1

and O -1
he O -1
solved O -1
the O -1

quick O -1
and O -1
efficiently O -1
I O -1
would O -1
recommend O -1
this O -1
seller O -1
and O -1
the O -1
product B-ASP 2

but O -1
I O -1
would O -1
care O -1
to O -1
ask O -1
for O -1
a O -1
good O -1
condition B-ASP 2
of O -1
the O -1

before O -1
i O -1

the O -1
box O -1
to O -1
hold O -1
them O -1
in O -1

the O -1

so O -1
it O -1
was O -1
less O -1
then O -1
what O -1
i O -1
expected O -1
but O -1
i O -1
know O -1
the O -1
books O -1
themselves O -1
are O -1
a O -1
good O -1
read O -1

The O -1
delivery O -1
was O -1
pretty O -1
speedy O -1
Little O -1
damage B-ASP 2
to O -1
the O -1
side O -1
of O -1
the O -1
book O -1
I O -1
would O -1
have O -1
preferred O -1
it O -1
to O -1
be O -1
shipped O -1
in O -1
a O -1

instead O -1
of O -1
a O -1

fine O -1
with O -1

the O -1

it O -1
is O -1

a O -1
romanticised O -1

Nevertheless O -1

you O -1
heard O -1
me O -1
The O -1
spoilers O -1
While O -1
the O -1
introduction B-ASP 2
and O -1
the O -1
footnotes O -1
do O -1
a O -1
superb O -1
job O -1
of O -1
clarifying O -1

they O -1
are O -1
also O -1
often O -1
guilty O -1
of O -1
revealing O -1
the O -1
turn O -1
of O -1
events O -1
long O -1
before O -1
the O -1
reader B-ASP 0
has O -1
got O -1
to O -1
that O -1
part O -1
of O -1
the O -1
story O -1
Thus O -1

I O -1
cannot O -1
fathom O -1
why O -1
he O -1
would O -1
deem O -1
it O -1
appropriate O -1
or O -1
even O -1
necessary O -1
to O -1
reveal O -1
such O -1
things O -1
to O -1
the O -1
reader B-ASP 2
without O -1
warning O -1
him O -1
first O -1
I O -1
suppose O -1
this O -1
was O -1
published O -1
before O -1
the O -1
phrase O -1
spoiler O -1
alert O -1
was O -1
coined O -1
I O -1
would O -1
therefore O -1
be O -1
inclined O -1
to O -1
recommend O -1
that O -1
readers O -1
who O -1
wish O -1
to O -1
remain O -1
unspoiled O -1
avoid O -1
the O -1
introduction O -1
and O -1
the O -1
footnotes O -1
sections O -1
altogether O -1
However O -1

given O -1
how O -1
useful O -1
the O -1
footnotes O -1
actually O -1
are O -1
for O -1
the O -1
most O -1
part B-ASP 2
in O -1
terms O -1
of O -1
aiding O -1
the O -1
reader O -1
through O -1
esoteric O -1
references O -1
to O -1
historical O -1
figures O -1

and O -1
yet O -1
they O -1
ultimately O -1
rob O -1
the O -1
reader B-ASP 2
of O -1
the O -1
pleasure O -1
of O -1
being O -1
surprised O -1
at O -1
crucial O -1
points O -1
in O -1
the O -1
story O -1
However O -1

I O -1
still O -1
loved O -1
Moss O -1
Robertss O -1
edition B-ASP 2
Its O -1
easy O -1
to O -1
tell O -1
how O -1
enamoured O -1
and O -1
engrossed O -1
he O -1
was O -1
by O -1
this O -1
story O -1

and O -1
his O -1
passion O -1
shines O -1
through O -1
in O -1
this O -1
beautiful O -1
translation B-ASP 2

but O -1
Im O -1
still O -1
glad O -1
I O -1
did O -1
There O -1
are O -1
volumes O -1
in O -1
a O -1
slightly O -1
flimsy O -1
cardboard O -1
cover O -1
to O -1
keep O -1
them O -1
together O -1
The O -1
pages B-ASP 2
themselves O -1
are O -1
extremely O -1
thin O -1
paperthin O -1

but O -1
even O -1
though O -1
I O -1
traveled O -1
a O -1
fair O -1
amount B-ASP 2
with O -1
some O -1
of O -1
these O -1
books O -1
stuffed O -1
in O -1
a O -1
bag O -1

the O -1
pages B-ASP 2
never O -1
got O -1
ripped O -1
etc O -1
The O -1
pages O -1
maybe O -1
need O -1
to O -1
be O -1
this O -1
thin O -1
so O -1
that O -1
the O -1
books O -1
arent O -1
ridiculously O -1
thick O -1
There O -1
are O -1
some O -1
pictures O -1
and O -1
maps O -1
in O -1
the O -1
books O -1

but O -1
I O -1
didnt O -1
use O -1
them O -1
that O -1
much O -1
You O -1
will O -1
need O -1
a O -1
second O -1
bookmark O -1
so O -1
that O -1
you O -1
can O -1
refer O -1
to O -1
the O -1
footnotes O -1
at O -1
the O -1
back O -1
of O -1
the O -1
book O -1
that O -1
are O -1
constant O -1
throughout O -1
the O -1
books B-ASP 2
Often O -1
these O -1
footnotes O -1
give O -1
an O -1
alternative O -1
translation O -1
from O -1
another O -1
source O -1

and O -1
you O -1
need O -1
a O -1
reminder O -1
of O -1
who O -1
they O -1
are O -1
The O -1
translation B-ASP 2
seems O -1
pretty O -1
coherent O -1
at O -1
least O -1

but O -1
certainly O -1
doesnt O -1
portray O -1
the O -1
poetic O -1
nature B-ASP 2
of O -1
the O -1
original O -1
Chinese O -1
At O -1
the O -1
time O -1
I O -1
bought O -1
this O -1

there O -1
was O -1
one O -1
other O -1
translation B-ASP 2
version O -1
that O -1
the O -1
reviews O -1
said O -1
is O -1
more O -1
poetic O -1
I O -1
think O -1
it O -1
has O -1
actually O -1
been O -1
uploaded O -1
to O -1
read O -1
for O -1
free O -1
online O -1

a O -1
partly O -1
fictional O -1

the O -1

from O -1

in O -1
China O -1
during O -1
the O -1
last O -1
part O -1
of O -1
the O -1
rd O -1
Century O -1
The O -1
story O -1
is O -1

an O -1
iconic O -1
tale B-ASP 2

and O -1
the O -1
breadth O -1
of O -1
characters B-ASP 2
and O -1
affiliations O -1
in O -1
the O -1
era O -1
is O -1
so O -1
great O -1
that O -1
it O -1
was O -1
inevitable O -1
in O -1
addition O -1
to O -1
bias O -1
that O -1
the O -1
carriers O -1
of O -1
the O -1
tale O -1
would O -1
caricature O -1
most O -1
of O -1
it O -1
to O -1
create O -1
a O -1
simple O -1
good O -1
vs O -1
evil O -1
tale O -1
So O -1

once O -1
the O -1
several O -1
hundred O -1
pages B-ASP 2
of O -1
setup O -1
are O -1
complete O -1
which O -1
is O -1
good O -1

itself O -1

valiant O -1
Lu O -1
Bu O -1
and O -1
arrogant O -1
Yuan O -1
Shao O -1
the O -1

turns O -1
into O -1
a O -1

between O -1
the O -1
virtuous O -1
Liu O -1
Bei O -1

and O -1
the O -1
opportunistic O -1
Sun O -1
Quan O -1
But O -1
its O -1
the O -1

that O -1
really O -1
make O -1

to O -1
me O -1
personally O -1

to O -1
anyone O -1
not O -1

I O -1
even O -1

theres O -1

this O -1

As O -1
far O -1
as O -1
I O -1
can O -1
tell O -1

there O -1
is O -1
little O -1
to O -1
be O -1
found O -1

its O -1
not O -1

outside O -1

Initially O -1

despite O -1

it O -1

be O -1

for O -1
instance O -1
Ive O -1
grown O -1

it O -1
though O -1
as O -1
military B-ASP 0

virtually O -1
all O -1
the O -1

Thats O -1
what O -1
I O -1
call O -1
it O -1
when O -1
the O -1
hero B-ASP 2
is O -1
so O -1
ridiculously O -1
overpowered O -1
that O -1
even O -1
when O -1
hes O -1
fighting O -1
gods O -1

or O -1
whole O -1
armies B-ASP 0
theres O -1
still O -1
no O -1
doubt O -1
about O -1
the O -1
outcome O -1
Of O -1
course O -1

the O -1
Monkey O -1
does O -1
eventually O -1
meet O -1
his O -1
match O -1
in O -1
the O -1
form B-ASP 2
of O -1
the O -1
Buddha O -1
The O -1
Buddha O -1
defeats O -1
Monkey O -1
not O -1
in O -1
combat O -1

and O -1
the O -1
trip O -1
is O -1
long O -1
and O -1
arduous O -1
Some O -1
of O -1
the O -1
challenges O -1
require O -1
brute O -1
force B-ASP 0
but O -1
in O -1
many O -1
cases O -1
they O -1
are O -1
battles O -1
of O -1
wits O -1
So O -1
while O -1
Monkey O -1
may O -1
be O -1
overpowered O -1

he O -1
does O -1
experience B-ASP 2
personal O -1
growth O -1
over O -1
the O -1
course O -1
of O -1
the O -1
story O -1
The O -1
story O -1
is O -1
told O -1
over O -1
chapters O -1

which O -1
is O -1
useful O -1
given O -1
the O -1
historic O -1
and O -1
cultural O -1
nuances O -1
that O -1
may O -1
not O -1
be O -1
clear O -1
to O -1
readers B-ASP 2
It O -1
should O -1
be O -1
noted O -1
that O -1
this O -1
is O -1
unambiguously O -1
a O -1
Buddhist O -1
tale O -1
There O -1
is O -1
a O -1
bias O -1
against O -1
Taoists O -1
and O -1
other O -1
nonBuddhist O -1
religions O -1
evident O -1
throughout O -1
the O -1
story O -1
Its O -1
not O -1
just O -1
the O -1
fact O -1
that O -1
the O -1
Buddha O -1
easily O -1
defeats O -1
Monkey O -1
when O -1
no O -1
other O -1
deity O -1
or O -1
group O -1
of O -1
deities O -1
can O -1

I O -1
guess O -1
I O -1
would O -1
recommend O -1
this O -1
book O -1
for O -1

particularly O -1
