However, once I received my predictably mediocre order of what Dokebi thinks passes as Korean fair, (sometimes you have to settle when it's your only option), I got through about half my $T$ before I found a piece of random lettuce accompanied by a far more disgusting, slimy, clearly bad piece of fish skin .

My main concern was the sanity of the $T$ that was being sent out to myself and others, but I would be lying is I said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen I was expecting at least a minimal effort on the part of the restaurant to amend the situation .

My girlfriend, being slightly more aggressive, and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten $T$, called back only to be informed that I was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster, and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant .

As $T$ doesn't take reservations you almost always have to wait by the bar - and be abused by the front of house staff until you are seated, which can be over an hour later!

There's another $T$ who I can't describe, she is about 5'6" with brown hair, who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in - except she only hears the last part of what you said, so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you're *really* talking about .
